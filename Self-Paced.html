          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>"Self-paced meditation" is not a standard or commonly used term in the field of meditation. However, it likely refers to a meditation practice in which individuals meditate at their own pace and on their own schedule, rather than following a structured or guided meditation led by an instructor.</p>

          <h2>Here's how Self-paced meditation generally works:</h2>
          <h3>Choose a Meditation Technique:</h3> 
          <p>Individuals start by choosing a meditation technique that aligns with their goals and preferences. There are various meditation techniques to choose from, such as mindfulness meditation, loving-kindness meditation, Zen meditation, mantra meditation, and more. The choice of technique depends on what the individual seeks to achieve through meditation.</p>

          <h3>Select a Comfortable Environment:</h3>
          <p>Practitioners find a quiet and comfortable place to meditate. It could be a dedicated meditation space, a peaceful corner in their home, or even an outdoor location.</p>
          <h3>Begin the Practice:</h3><p> When it's time to meditate, individuals start their meditation session. They typically sit comfortably with their eyes closed, focusing on their chosen meditation technique. For example, in mindfulness meditation, they may focus on their breath or observe their thoughts and sensations without judgment. In mantra meditation, they may silently repeat a mantra. The specific practice depends on the chosen technique.</p>
          <h3>Self-Guided Mindfulness:</h3><p> During self-paced meditation, practitioners guide themselves through the practice. They rely on their own knowledge of the technique and their ability to maintain focus. There is no external instructor or guided audio leading the meditation.</p>
          <h3>Ongoing Practice:</h3><p>Self-paced meditation is an ongoing practice that individuals can continue at their own pace. They have the freedom to explore and deepen their practice over time, adapting it to their changing needs and goals.</p>
